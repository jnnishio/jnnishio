## Hi! Iâ€™m Jason, a rising senior at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley. I am currently a student research intern at the UCSF Francis I. Proctor Foundation for Research in Ophthalmology. I'm interested in machine learning, computational biology/bioinformatics, explainable AI, computational modeling of biological processes, the brain, bioengineering, statistics, and quantum computing.

### Take a look at some of my projects! (click on the links to see papers & more!)
  
**[Magnification Independent Multi-Classification of Breast Cancer in Histopathology Images Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/jnnishio/Breast-Cancer)**
  
- Versatile DL framework for early detection of breast cancer in histopathological images
- Novel image preprocessing/normalization techniques
- Tackling breast cancer classification tasks for 8 types of breast tumors, independent of magnification factor

**[Early Detection and Severity Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Through Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://github.com/jnnishio/Diabetic-Retinopathy)**

- Novel image processing methods for retina fundus scans
- Severity level classification for 5 stages of diabetic retinopathy: Healthy, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferate
- App development for real-time screening

**[Evaluating the Effects of Color and Image Manipulation on Classification of Cervical Spondylosis X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/jnnishio/Cervical-Spondylosis)**
- Color manipulations & image processing for spinal X-rays
- Use of both classical CNNs and quantum CNNs (Q-CNNs) to classify cervical spondylosis
- Comparative analysis of quantum computing vs deep learning
