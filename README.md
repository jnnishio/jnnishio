## Hi! Iâ€™m Jason, a junior at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley. I'm interested in machine learning, computational biology/bioinformatics, explainable AI, computational modeling of biological processes, the brain, bioengineering, statistics, and quantum computing.

### Take a look at some of my projects! (click on the links to see papers and more!)  
<sub>Note: my GitHub page is newly set up, so much of the material is taken from my brother's repositories, where we have been keeping our code.</sub>  
  
[Magnification Independent Multi-Classification of Breast Cancer in Histopathology Images Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/jnnishio/Breast-Cancer)
  
- Versatile DL framework for early detection of breast cancer 
- Novel image preprocessing/normalization techniques
- Tackling breast cancer classification tasks for 8 different classes of breast tumors on histopathological images, independent of magnification factor

[Early Detection and Severity Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Through Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://github.com/jnnishio/Diabetic-Retinopathy)

- Novel image processing techniques for retina fundus scans
- Severity level classification for 5 stages of diabetic retinopathy: Healthy, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferate
- App development for real-time screening


[Evaluating the Effects of Color and Image Manipulation on Classification of Cervical Spondylosis X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/jnnishio/Cervical-Spondylosis)
- Color manipulations & image processing for spinal X-rays
- Use of both classical CNNs and quantum CNNs (Q-CNNs) to classify cervical spondylosis
- Comparative analysis of quantum computing vs deep learning
