## Hi! I’m Jason, a senior at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley. I am currently a student research intern at the UCSF Francis I. Proctor Foundation for Research in Ophthalmology. 
#### I'm interested in machine learning, computational biology/bioinformatics, explainable AI, computational modeling of biological processes, the brain, bioengineering, statistics, and quantum computing.
